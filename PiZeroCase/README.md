# A simple Raspberry Pi Zero Case #

Please note that this file has not yet been test printed, it's based on the dimensions from the official data sheet and measurements of my cables for the sizes and shapes of the connecting plugs.
Hopefully my board will be arriving shortly and I'll have chance to do a print and check.
